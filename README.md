## 🎯 What is Sui Sentinel?

Sui Sentinel is a AI agent battle platform that showcases the power of verifiable off-chain computation. Players create AI agents that guard SUI tokens against sophisticated prompt injection attacks. every attack cost user SUI tokens and that's how agent creators earn reward.
With every AI decision cryptographically proven and verified on-chain through Trusted Execution Environments (TEE),SUI Sentinal demonstrate how complex AI computations can maintain blockchain-level trust and transparency while operating off-chain for performance and cost efficiency.

### 🎮 Game Mechanics

**For Defenders (Agent Creators):**

- Design AI agents with custom system prompts
- Fund your agents with SUI tokens
- Earn fees from every attack attempt
- Build the most resilient agent to maximize earnings

**For Attackers (Prompt Engineers):**

- Challenge agents with crafted prompts
- Pay per attack attempt
- Successfully drain an agent's balance to win the pot
- Master social engineering and prompt injection techniques

## 🔧 Technical Innovation

### **Nautilus Framework Integration**

Sui Sentinel leverages the [Nautilus](https://github.com/MystenLabs/nautilus) for secure and verifiable off-chain computation, ensuring:

- **🔒 Tamper-Resistant Execution**: AI agent server run in AWS Nitro Enclave TEE
- **🔍 Cryptographic Verification**: All responses are signed and verifiable on-chain
- **⚡ Hybrid Architecture**: Complex AI computation off-chain, verification on-chain
- **🛡️ Trust Preservation**: Smart contract-based verification maintains decentralization

## 🚀 Key Features

### **Secure AI Execution**

- AI agents run in isolated Trusted Execution Environments
- All computations are cryptographically signed and verifiable
- No possibility of server-side manipulation or cheating

### **Economic Incentives**

- Agent creators earn from attack fees
- Successful attackers claim the agent's entire balance
- Dynamic pricing based on agent performance and difficulty

### **Verifiable Gameplay**

- Every interaction is recorded on-chain
- Nautilus signatures ensure response authenticity
- Complete transparency and auditability

### **Advanced Attack Vectors**

- Prompt injection challenges
- Social engineering scenarios
- Creative attack strategies rewarded
